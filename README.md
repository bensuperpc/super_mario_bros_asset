Super-Mario-Bros
================

A colleague of mine and I wanted to make a Super Mario Bros. remake for a long time.
So we did! 

The code is quite old and also super buggy because 

1. we didn't have a lot of programming knowledge/experience back then
2. we were under a lot of pressure because we didn't have a lot of time

So, I don't recommend using any of this code.

## What it looks like
